        <h2>Frequently Asked</h2>
        If your question is not answered here or you have other queries, do <a href="about#contact-details">get in touch</a>.
        <br><br>
        <mark class="question">Can teams have fewer than four students?</mark> Yes, but ideally not – there are no measures in the rounds to balance for teams with fewer than four students. If you don't have four students, you may register the team as <i>looking for groups</i>: we will combine these students with others to form teams of four for the day of the competition where possible.
        <br><br>
        <mark class="question">Why is the competition only recommended for Years 12-13?</mark> The competition features a notable amount of AS-Level content which Year 11 students will be unlikely to have covered thoroughly in school. It is nevertheless open to them to compete, if they are interested!
        <br><br>
        <mark class="question">How many teams can participate from my school?</mark> We cannot guarantee schools can have multiple teams – let alone any! Nevertheless, we encourage schools to register as many teams as they would like as the online contest has no restriction.
        <br><br>
        <mark class="question">If one of my students can't participate, but there's another student who wanted to join, is it possible to swap them?</mark> We can't have five of your students show up as one team, but we are willing to discuss it on a case-by-case basis. Get in touch.
        <br><br>
        <mark class="question">Is the venue accessible?</mark> Whilst the venue is not confirmed yet, we will secure a wheelchair-accessible venue. If you have any other accessibility concerns or adjustment requests – e.g., visual access – please <a href="about.html#contact-details">get in touch</a>.
