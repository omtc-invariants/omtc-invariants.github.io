        <h1>Logistical Overview</h1>
        <h3>Offline OMTC</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Date</b>: Friday, 27th February 2026</li>
            <li><b>Location</b>: Examination Schools, University of Oxford. See below for directions.</li>
            <li><b>Who</b>: Students in Years 11-13 (recommended for Years 12-13).</li>
            <li><b>Team Size</b>: up to four students – no more than two of whom are in Year 13.</li>
            <li><b>Cost</b>: Free! However, we are unable to offer lunch this year nor transport subsidies.</li>
        </ul>
        Students must be accompanied by responsible adults at a ratio of 1:10 adults:students (responsible adults are, for example, teachers or parents). This means that you can, for example, have one adult for two teams, or two adult for five teams.<br><br>
        
        If your team registers to be <i>looking for groups</i>, we will liaise with responsible adults so that only one of them needs to attend for the day. Also, if multiple teams from the same school participate in the in-person event, we can liaise with responsible adults for only one responsible adult to attend for two teams. 
        <br><br>

        <p>We’re delighted to announce that Professor Robin Wilson of the Open University, and fellow at Keble College, will be our guest speaker this year. We are also doing short college tours for students to get a glimpse into student life at Oxford (and see the pretty buildings).</p>

        <h2>How to get here</h2>

        <p>The address of the Examination Schools is 75 - 81 High St, Oxford OX1 4BG.</p>

        <p>See the <a class="glink" href="https://www.oxford.gov.uk/parking-travel/get-oxford" target="_blank">Oxford City Council's page</a> for general travel information to Oxford. We note that it is a 10-15 minute walk from the train station to the Examination Schools, and several bus services have a stop directly opposite the Examination Schools. As the Council's page mentions, there are currently congestion charges for vehicles going into the city centre, so it is suggested to park at a nearby park-and-ride and take public transport for the remainder of the journey.</p>

    <div id="faq">
        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        If your question is not answered here or you have other queries, do <a href="about#contact-details" class="glink">get in touch</a>.
        <br><br>
        <mark class="question">Can teams have fewer than four students?</mark> Yes, but ideally not – there are no measures in the rounds to balance for teams with fewer than four students. If you don’t have four students, you may register the team as <i>looking for groups</i>: we will combine these students with others to form teams of four for the day of the competition where possible.
        <br><br>
        <mark class="question">Why is the competition only recommended for Years 12-13?</mark> The competition features a notable amount of AS-Level content which Year 11 students will be unlikely to have covered thoroughly in school. It is nevertheless open to them to compete, if they are interested!
        <br><br>
        <mark class="question">How many teams can participate from my school?</mark> We encourage schools to register in blocks of two or five teams, however people may submit as many teams as they would like for the online competition.
        <br><br>
        <mark class="question">If one of my students can’t participate, but there’s another student who wanted to join, is it possible to swap them?</mark> We can’t have five of your students show up as one team, but we are willing to discuss it on a case-by-case basis. <a href="about#contact-details" class="glink">Get in touch</a>.
        <br><br>
        <mark class="question">Is the venue accessible?</mark> The Examination Schools are wheelchair-accessible. Please mention any accessibility requirements in the registration form.
